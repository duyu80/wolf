@W: MT531 :"e:\work\wolf\baseboard\bld\..\src\i2c.v":122:43:122:82|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 16 sequential elements including I2C_INS_1.CHECKSUM_OUT[7:0].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"e:\work\wolf\baseboard\bld\..\src\gpi.v":79:0:79:5|Found inferred clock BB_TOP|SYSCLK which controls 2022 sequential elements including GPI0_INST.DOUT2[7:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
