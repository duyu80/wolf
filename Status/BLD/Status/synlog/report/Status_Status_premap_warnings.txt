@W: MT529 :"e:\work\wolf\status\bld\..\src\gpio.v":96:0:96:5|Found inferred clock TOP|SYSCLK which controls 575 sequential elements including GPIO_INST.DOUT[7:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
