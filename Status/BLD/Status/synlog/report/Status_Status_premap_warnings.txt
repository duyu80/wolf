@W: MT462 :"f:\project\wolf\status\bld\..\src\i2c.v":122:43:122:48|Net I2C_INST.un1_CNT8 appears to be an unidentified clock source. Assuming default frequency. 
@W: MT531 :"f:\project\wolf\status\bld\..\src\i2c.v":122:43:122:82|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 8 sequential elements including I2C_INST.CHECKSUM_OUT[7:0].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"f:\project\wolf\status\bld\..\src\gpio.v":96:0:96:5|Found inferred clock TOP|SYSCLK which controls 568 sequential elements including GPIO_INST.DOUT[7:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
